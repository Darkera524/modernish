Modernish: TODO

* opts/long: For shells that can't use "getopts" in a function, make a
  version that completely re-implements getopts in the shell language.

Modules/functions to write:

* var/string: String manipulation functions. Some ideas:
	repeat <num> <str>
	leftstr <num> <str>
	rightstr <num> <str>
	midstr <num1> <num2> <str>
	chopleft <num> <varname>
	chopright <num> <varname>

* pax: On systems that don't have the POSIX standard 'pax' archiver,
  re-implement POSIX 'pax' as a shell function using 'tar' and 'cpio',
  using feature testing to adapt to their variants.

* readlink (use feature testing to find the best symlink reading method)

* getfilemode: get permission bits of a file (how?)
