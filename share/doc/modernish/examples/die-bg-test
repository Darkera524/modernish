# even from a background subshell.

# Conversely, the trap on INT (user presses Ctrl-C) demonstrates how to kill
# the background job from the main shell (which was always possible).

# Demonstrate that modernish has a SIGDIE pseudosignal; its traps will be
# executed when 'die' is called. The pseudosignal cannot be ignored.
