# 'print' and 'echo'
#
# 'print' prints each argument on a separate line (unlike 'echo' which
# prints all arguments on one line). There is no processing of options or
# escape codes. NOTE: this is completely different from ksh/zsh 'print'.
#
# POSIX: "It is not possible to use echo portably across all POSIX systems
# unless both -n (as the first argument) and escape sequences are omitted."
# http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/echo.html#tag_20_37_16
#
# Provide a modernish version of 'echo', so at least all modernish programs can
# safely expect the same behaviour. This version does not interpret any control
# characters and supports only one option, '-n', which, like BSD 'echo',
# suppresses the newline. However, unlike BSD 'echo', if '-n' is the only
# argument, it is not interpreted as an option and the string '-n' is printed
# instead. This makes it safe to output arbitrary data using this version of
# 'echo' as long as it is given as a single argument (using quoting if needed).

# with 'test', the arguments are shell integer arith expressions, which can
# be anything from simple numbers to complex expressions. As with $(( )),
# variable names are expanded to their values even without the '$'.
#
# Portability note: bash, ksh and zsh do recursive evaluation of variable
# names (where a variable can contain the name of another variable, and so
# forth), but that is non-standard and unportable.
#
# Function:		Returns succcessfully if:
# --------		------------------------
# eq <expr> <expr>	the two expressions evaluate to the same number
# ne <expr> <expr>	the two expressions evaluate to different numbers
# lt <expr> <expr>	the 1st expr evaluates to a smaller number than the 2nd
# le <expr> <expr>	the 1st expr eval's to smaller than or equal to the 2nd
# gt <expr> <expr>	the 1st expr evaluates to a greater number than the 2nd
# ge <expr> <expr>	the 1st expr eval's to greater than or equal to the 2nd
#
# Example:
# if eq 2+2 4; then echo 'freedom granted; all else follows'; fi
#
# The arith operator itself does sufficient validation on all shells, though
# error messages are not always very clear.
#
# As a performance hack, the functions below abuse this arith validation in
# combination with parameter substitution to check for excess arguments, by
# injecting a guaranteed-to-be-invalid value (starting with an escaped '\') in
# case of excess arguments. According to my tests, this is completely reliable
# in every shell, and causes no noticable performance reduction. Not only
# that, many shells (not zsh or yash) helpfully insert the invalid value into
# its own error message, so we can add our own message ('excess arguments') to
# be passed on.
#
# Shells exit on arith evaluation errors, so the usual "|| die" is ineffective
# and we can't terminate the program properly from a subshell. I have made the
# choice that the performance gain is worth it in this instance.
#
# Note: the inversion of comparison operators is NOT a bug! POSIX arith is
# based on the C language, so uses 1 for true and 0 for false, whereas the
# shell language itself does the inverse. The fastest way to invert the result
# code is to invert the operators.
