# This is a bug making 'use safe' less convenient to work with. Workarounds
# are necessary in library code (search for BUG_UPP to find them).
# The following workarounds are the most convenient:
#	* Instead of "$@", use: ${1+"$@"}
#	* Instead of "$*", use: ${1+"$*"}
#	* Instead of 'for var do', use: 'for var in ${1+"$@"}; do'
# However, BUG_PARONEARG in bash makes these impossible when under 'use safe'!
# Universally compatible workarounds include:
#	* Testing 'if thisshellhas BUG_UPP' before using the above workarounds;
#	  no shell is known to exist that has both BUG_UPP and BUG_PARONEARG.
#	* Testing that $# is greater than 0 before accessing "$@" or "$*".
#	* Using "${@:-}" instead of "$@" and coping with an extra empty argument
#	  if there are no positional parameters (note: "${@-}" without the ':'
#	  does not work on all shells).
# The 'safe' module will refuse to initialize by default if BUG_UPP is found.

# Shell-quote the values of one or more variables to prepare them for
# safe use with "eval" or other parsing by the shell. If a value only
# contains shell-safe characters, it leaves it unquoted. Empty values
# are quoted.
#
# Usage: shellquote [ <options> ] <varname> ... [ [ <options> ] <varname> ... ]
#
# Options take effect for all variable names following them. Each option
# must be a separate argument.
# -f	Force quoting, even if value only contains shell-safe characters.
#	This is useful for e.g. producing string literals for glob patterns
#	or regular expressions.
# +f	Don't quote if value only contains shell-safe characters. (Default)
# -n N	(N>=1): Multiple quoting levels: quote N times. (Default: 1)
#
# Returns success (0) if all variables were processed successfully, and
# non-success (1) if any undefined (unset) variables were encountered. Unset
# variables are left alone. It continues even after encountering an unset
# variable.
#
# Inspired by "Rich's sh (POSIX shell) tricks":
# http://www.etalabs.net/sh_tricks.html
# under "Shell-quoting arbitrary strings":
# quote () { printf %s\\n "$1" | sed "s/'/'\\\\''/g;1s/^/'/;\$s/\$/'/" ; }
# Rich uses a command substitution with "sed" for this, launching two
# processes for each value to quote. The "shellquote" function does the same
# thing, but in-place. As it doesn't launch any subshells or external
# processes, it's more than 10 times faster (on bash, only 5-ish times).
#
# TODO?
# - option for reading stdin, producing quoted output?
# - option for quoting values rather than variables?
# - option for output to stdout instead of setting variable?
#
# TODO:
# - use printf %q in bash, zsh and AT&T ksh
# - BUG: if variable is readonly, shell exits/aborts, so IFS/globbing is not
#        restored on interactive shell. But testing readonly needs a
#        subshell: performance hit. What to do?

# Stack functions.
# Every variable has its own stack: simply do push VAR and pop VAR.
# Also works for saving/restoring shell options, e.g.: push -f; pop -f
# Uses global variable namespace: _Msh__V*__S*
#
# Features:
#	- Saves and restores not just value, but set/unset state.
#	- Stack size is limited by memory or shell constraints only.
#	- Fast: does not launch any subshell or external process.
#	- Cleans up after itself: leaves no trace in the environment upon
#         empty stack.
#
# Use cases:
#	- Easily store lots of arbitary data to use later.
#	- Code blocks (not just functions) with 'fake' local variables.
#	- Easy temporary field splitting ('push IFS' and 'pop IFS' work fine).

# Push each variable's value or shell option setting on its respective stack.
# Usage: push <item> [ <item> ...]
#	where <item> is a variable name or shell option (dash plus letter).

# harden: modernish's replacement for 'set -e' (errexit)
#
# Function that installs a function to harden commands by testing their exit
# status against values indicating error or system failure. Upon failure,
# 'harden' calls 'die', so it will reliably halt program execution, even if
# the failure occurred within a subshell (for instance, in a pipe construct
# or command substitution).
#
# Usage: harden [ as <funcname> ] [ -p ] [ -t ] <commandname/path> <testexpr>
# The <testexpr> is like a shell arithmetic expression, with the binary
# operators '==' '!=' '<=' '>=' '<' '>' turned into unary operators.
# Everything else is the same, including && and || and parentheses.
# Options:
#	-p: Do not die if the command is killed by a broken pipe.
#	-t: Trace the command (uses file descriptor 9).
# Usage examples:
#	harden grep '> 1': grep fails on exit status > 1
#	harden grep '>= 2': equivalent to the above
#	harden gzip '==1 || >2': 1 and >2 are errors, but 2 isn't (see 'man gzip')

# 'print' and 'echo'
#
# 'print' prints each argument on a separate line (unlike 'echo' which
# prints all arguments on one line). There is no processing of options or
# escape codes. NOTE: this is completely different from ksh/zsh 'print'.
#
# POSIX: "It is not possible to use echo portably across all POSIX systems
# unless both -n (as the first argument) and escape sequences are omitted."
# http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/echo.html#tag_20_37_16
#
# Provide a modernish version of 'echo', so at least all modernish programs can
# safely expect the same behaviour. This version does not interpret any control
# characters and supports only one option, '-n', which, like BSD 'echo',
# suppresses the newline. However, unlike BSD 'echo', if '-n' is the only
# argument, it is not interpreted as an option and the string '-n' is printed
# instead. This makes it safe to output arbitrary data using this version of
# 'echo' as long as it is given as a single argument (using quoting if needed).

# Implementation of 'let' as in ksh, bash, zsh and busybox ash, for shells
# without it.
# Usage: let <expr> [ <expr> ... ]
# where <expr> is an arithmetic expression as in $(( ... )).
# http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_06_04

# The exit status is 1 if the last expression evaluates to 0, and 0 if not.
# (0 and 1 in C-style boolean are the opposite of 0 and 1 in shell boolean, so
# this means it does the right true-or-false thing for the shell.)
#
# NOTE: the prefix and postfix "++" and "--" operators are NOT required by
# POSIX and not portable. The ID 'ARITHPP' is assigned to this feature, so
# if you want to use ++/-- you should first check if "thisshellhas ARITHPP".
# Otherwise, for example, instead of 'let X++', use 'let X+=1'.
#
# Shells immediately exit on arith evaluation error, so the usual "|| die"
# check on errors is ineffective.
#
# There are two portability problems with 'let' builtins:
#   1.	On AT&T ksh, the first expression cannot start with a '-' as it will
#	be interpreted as an option, even though its "let" doesn't have any
#	valid options. The end-of-options delimeter '--' is needed for the
#	first expression to start with '-'. However, on pdksh/mksh and
#	Busybox ash, '--' is not accepted and will throw a syntax error.
#	These situations are irreconcilable without a workaround.
#	(Bash and zsh accept '--' but don't require them, even if the first
#	expression starts with '-'.)
#   2.  Some ash derivatives (such as FreeBSD /bin/sh) have an undocumented
#	and incompatible 'let' builtin that only takes one expression (and
#	uselessly outputs the result to standard output).
# So let's test if we have a version that works as expected and override the
# builtin if it's not up to scratch.

# --- General file tests. ---
# The can() and is() functions deal correctly with empty removal so are good
# to use with 'use safe' and unquoted variables. They also use substantially
# different and more intuitive logic than 'test', '[' and '[[' do; see below.
# can():
#	--- permsision tests ---
#	can read, can write:
#		Test if this program can read from or write to a file or
#		directory. Work around botched '['/'[[' logic that claims
#		you can (-r)ead from or (-w)rite to a directory even if its
#		"x" bit is not set. (-d && ( -[rw] && -x ) || -[rw])
#	can exec
#		Test if non-directory file is executable. (-x && ! -d)
#	can traverse:
#		Test if you can traverse through a directory. (-x && -d)
#		Distinct from 'can exec' to help avoid bugs.
# is():
#	--- ownership tests ---
#	is ssetuid, is setgid:
#		Test if file has user or group ID bits set.
#	is mine, is mygroup:
#		Test if file is owned by user or by current user's main
#		group. (Note: the -O and -G test/[ operators are technically
#		non-standard, but their support in shells that can run the
#		rest of modernish is universal.)
#	--- type tests ---
#	is reg, is dir, is fifo, is socket, is blockspecial, is charspecial:
#		Test if file is a regular file, directory, socket, block
#		special device or character special device, respectively.
#		NOTE: Unlike [/[[, these tests do *not* resolve symlinks
#		unless the -L option is used! This is to promote security
#		and discourage allowing symlink attacks.
#	is -L reg, is -L dir, is -L fifo, etc.
#		Same as above but resolve symlinks before testing. For
#		example, 'is -L reg file.txt' could mean file.txt is a
#		regular file or a symlink to a regular file.
#	is sym:
#		Test if file is a symlink.
#	is -L sym:
#		Test if file is a valid symlink.
#	is present:
#		Test if file exists (even if it's an invalid symlink).
#	is -L present:
#		Test if file exists and is not an invalid symlink.
#	--- content test ---
#	is nonempty:
#		Test if file exists, is not an invalid symlink, and is non-empty. Unlike 'test -s',
#		this also works for directories in which you have read permission (both r and x
#		bits set). A race condition with tests like this is inevitable (even with the
#		traditional 'test -s'). Be careful with parallel processing!
#		Exit status:
#		0: file or directory (after resolving any symlinks) is not empty
#		1: file or directory is empty, doesn't exist, or is an invalid symlink
#		2: no read permission in directory, so cannot test if directory is empty
#		The directory testing method was kindly provided by Stéphane Chazelas in:
#		Message-ID: <20150524190928.GB6744@chaz.gmail.com>
#		https://groups.google.com/forum/#!original/comp.unix.shell/M_gDU9uk8Rk/FyiS9m-RFYAJ
#		BUG: reads entire directory; slow/expensive for very large directories.
#	--- file descriptor test ---
#	is onterminal:
#		Test if file descriptor is open and associated with a terminal.
#		(Note: POSIX specifies that file descriptors can be 0 to minimum 19,
#		but most shells only support file descriptors between 0 and 9.)
#	--- comparison tests (2 arguments) ---
#	is newer, is older, is samefile:
#		Test if file 1 is newer than, older than, or (through hard
#		links or symlinks) the same file as file 2. (Note: the -nt,
#		-ot and -ef test/[ operators are technically non-standard, but
#		their support in shells that can run the rest of modernish is
#		universal.)
