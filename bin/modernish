# if that access is implicit in a 'for' loop (as in 'for var do stuff; done').
# This is against the standard:
#     "-u: When the shell tries to expand an unset parameter OTHER THAN THE

# (under '-u').
# This is a bug making 'use safe' less convenient to work with. Workarounds
# are necessary in library code (search for BUG_UPP to find them).
# The following workarounds are the most convenient:
#	* Instead of "$@", use: ${1+"$@"}
#	* Instead of "$*", use: ${1+"$*"}
#	* Instead of 'for var do', use: 'for var in ${1+"$@"}; do'
# However, BUG_PARONEARG in bash makes these impossible when under 'use safe'!
# Universally compatible workarounds include:
#	* Testing 'if thisshellhas BUG_UPP' before using the above workarounds;
#	  no shell is known to exist that has both BUG_UPP and BUG_PARONEARG.
#	* Testing that $# is greater than 0 before accessing "$@" or "$*".
#	* Using "${@:-}" instead of "$@" and coping with an extra empty argument
#	  if there are no positional parameters (note: "${@-}" without the ':'
#	  does not work on all shells).
# The 'safe' module will refuse to initialize by default if BUG_UPP is found.
# To 'use safe' on a shell with this bug, say:
#     use safe -w BUG_UPP
# to get around the block, and implement workarounds in your script as above.

# even though 'false' is a builtin that is active by default, ksh93's command
# to activate it it will succeed, yielding status 0. On bash, zsh and pdksh/

# ----------------

# Stack functions.
# Every variable has its own stack: simply do push VAR and pop VAR.
# Also works for saving/restoring shell options, e.g.: push -f; pop -f
# Uses global variable namespace: _Msh__V*__S*
#
# Features:
#	- Saves and restores not just value, but set/unset state.
#	- Stack size is limited by memory or shell constraints only.
#	- Fast: does not launch any subshell or external process.
#	- Cleans up after itself: leaves no trace in the environment upon
#         empty stack.
#
# Use cases:
#	- Easily store lots of arbitary data to use later.
#	- Code blocks (not just functions) with 'fake' local variables.
#	- Easy temporary field splitting ('push IFS' and 'pop IFS' work fine).

# Push each variable's value or shell option setting on its respective stack.
# Usage: push <item> [ <item> ...]
#	where <item> is a variable name or shell option (dash plus letter).

# harden: modernish's replacement for 'set -e' (errexit)
#
# Function that installs a function to harden commands by testing their exit
# status against values indicating error or system failure. Upon failure,
# 'harden' calls 'die', so it will reliably halt program execution, even if
# the failure occurred within a subshell (for instance, in a pipe construct
# or command substitution).
#
# Usage: harden [ as <funcname> ] [ -[ptP] ] [ -e <testexpr> ] \
#	[ <var=value> ... ] [ -u <var> ... ] <cmdname/path> [ <arg> ... ]
#
# The <testexpr> is like a shell arithmetic expression, with the binary
# operators '==' '!=' '<=' '>=' '<' '>' turned into unary operators.
# Everything else is the same, including && and || and parentheses.
#
# <var=value> assignments cause corresponding environment variables to be
# exported with the values indicated for the duration of the command. If the
# command is a shell function, this will cause it to be run in a subshell.
# Assignments override corresponding unset (-u) options, even subsequent ones.
#
# Options:
#	-p: Use system default path instead of current $PATH to find
#	    external commands (akin to POSIX 'command -p').
#	-P: Do not die if the command is killed by a broken pipe.
#	-t: Trace the command (uses file descriptor 9).
#	-u: Unset a shell or environment variable for the duration of the command.
#	    (Causes the command to be run in a subshell.)
# Usage examples:
#	harden -e '> 1' grep			# grep fails on exit status > 1
#	harden -e '>= 2' grep			# equivalent to the above
#	harden -e '==1 || >2' gzip		# 1 and >2 are errors, but 2 isn't (see 'man gzip')
#	harden as findWord -Pe '>1' grep -w	# hardened function 'findWord' uses 'grep -w', tolerating SIGPIPE
#
# What exit status indicates failure depends on the command. For standard
# commands, refer to the POSIX standard. For others, see their manual pages.
#
# To harden a shell function, alias, command with full pathname,
# or any command with a name that would be invalid for a shell
# function, you have to harden it 'as' a different name.

# escape codes. NOTE: this is completely different from ksh/zsh 'print'.
#
# POSIX: "It is not possible to use echo portably across all POSIX systems
# unless both -n (as the first argument) and escape sequences are omitted."
# http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/echo.html#tag_20_37_16
#
# Provide a modernish version of 'echo', so at least all modernish programs can
# safely expect the same behaviour. This version does not interpret any control
# characters and supports only one option, '-n', which, like BSD 'echo',
# suppresses the newline. However, unlike BSD 'echo', if '-n' is the only
# argument, it is not interpreted as an option and the string '-n' is printed
# instead. This makes it safe to output arbitrary data using this version of
# 'echo' as long as it is given as a single argument (using quoting if needed).

# ---- Arithmetic tests and operations. ----

# Implementation of 'let' as in ksh, bash, zsh and busybox ash, for shells
# without it.
# Usage: let <expr> [ <expr> ... ]
# where <expr> is an arithmetic expression as in $(( ... )).
# http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_06_04
#
# The exit status is 1 if the last expression evaluates to 0, and 0 if not.
# (0 and 1 in C-style boolean are the opposite of 0 and 1 in shell boolean, so
# this means it does the right true-or-false thing for the shell.)
#
# NOTE: the prefix and postfix "++" and "--" operators are NOT required by
# POSIX and not portable. The ID 'ARITHPP' is assigned to this feature, so
# if you want to use ++/-- you should first check if "thisshellhas ARITHPP".
# Otherwise, for example, instead of 'let X++', use 'let X+=1'.
#
# Shells immediately exit on arith evaluation error, so the usual "|| die"
# check on errors is ineffective.
#
# There are two portability problems with 'let' builtins:
#   1.	On AT&T ksh, the first expression cannot start with a '-' as it will
#	be interpreted as an option, even though its "let" doesn't have any
#	valid options. The end-of-options delimeter '--' is needed for the
#	first expression to start with '-'. However, on pdksh/mksh and
#	Busybox ash, '--' is not accepted and will throw a syntax error.
#	These situations are irreconcilable without a workaround.
#	(Bash and zsh accept '--' but don't require them, even if the first
#	expression starts with '-'.)
#   2.  Some ash derivatives (such as FreeBSD /bin/sh) have an undocumented
#	and incompatible 'let' builtin that only takes one expression (and
#	uselessly outputs the result to standard output).
# So let's test if we have a version that works as expected and override the
# builtin if it's not up to scratch.

# Glob pattern test.
# Usage: match <string> <glob-pattern>
#
# Unfortunately, many shells don't properly support passing a glob pattern
# with backslash-escaped characters from a variable. But the behaviour with
# patterns as string literals is the same on all shells. To ensure
# portability, we must use 'eval' to parse patterns containing backslashes
# as string literals. This involves backslash-quoting the pattern in a
# special way to make it safe for 'eval' while preserving already-quoted
# characters and avoiding quoting glob pattern characters '?', '*' and '['.
#	With this method, the only portability issue left is a final single
# backslash in the pattern. Shells vary. POSIX says: "If a pattern ends with
# an unescaped <backslash>, it is unspecified whether the pattern does not
# match anything or the pattern is treated as invalid." In fact, some shells
# do neither and match it as if it were an escaped backslash. To ensure the
# same behaviour on all shells, specifically check for a dangling final
# backslash and treat it as invalid by returning exit status 2.

# --- General file tests. ---
# The can() and is() functions deal correctly with empty removal so are good
# to use with 'use safe' and unquoted variables. They also use substantially
# different and more intuitive logic than 'test', '[' and '[[' do; see below.
# can():
#	--- permsision tests ---
#	can read, can write:
#		Test if this program can read from or write to a file or
#		directory. Work around botched '['/'[[' logic that claims
#		you can (-r)ead from or (-w)rite to a directory even if its
#		"x" bit is not set. (-d && ( -[rw] && -x ) || -[rw])
#	can exec
#		Test if non-directory file is executable. (-x && ! -d)
#	can traverse:
#		Test if you can traverse through a directory. (-x && -d)
#		Distinct from 'can exec' to help avoid bugs.
# is():
#	--- ownership tests ---
#	is ssetuid, is setgid:
#		Test if file has user or group ID bits set.
#	is mine, is mygroup:
#		Test if file is owned by user or by current user's main
#		group. (Note: the -O and -G test/[ operators are technically
#		non-standard, but their support in shells that can run the
#		rest of modernish is universal.)
#	--- type tests ---
#	is reg, is dir, is fifo, is socket, is blockspecial, is charspecial:
#		Test if file is a regular file, directory, socket, block
#		special device or character special device, respectively.
#		NOTE: Unlike [/[[, these tests do *not* resolve symlinks
#		unless the -L option is used! This is to promote security
#		and discourage allowing symlink attacks.
#	is -L reg, is -L dir, is -L fifo, etc.
#		Same as above but resolve symlinks before testing. For
#		example, 'is -L reg file.txt' could mean file.txt is a
#		regular file or a symlink to a regular file.
#	is sym:
#		Test if file is a symlink.
#	is -L sym:
#		Test if file is a valid symlink.
#	is present:
#		Test if file exists (even if it's an invalid symlink).
#	is -L present:
#		Test if file exists and is not an invalid symlink.
#	--- content test ---
#	is nonempty:
#		Test if file exists, is not an invalid symlink, and is non-empty. Unlike 'test -s',
#		this also works for directories in which you have read permission (both r and x
#		bits set). A race condition with tests like this is inevitable (even with the
#		traditional 'test -s'). Be careful with parallel processing!
#		Exit status:
#		0: file or directory (after resolving any symlinks) is not empty
#		1: file or directory is empty, doesn't exist, or is an invalid symlink
#		2: no read permission in directory, so cannot test if directory is empty
#		The directory testing method was kindly provided by Stéphane Chazelas in:
#		Message-ID: <20150524190928.GB6744@chaz.gmail.com>
#		https://groups.google.com/forum/#!original/comp.unix.shell/M_gDU9uk8Rk/FyiS9m-RFYAJ
#		BUG: reads entire directory; slow/expensive for very large directories.
#	--- file descriptor test ---
#	is onterminal:
#		Test if file descriptor is open and associated with a terminal.
#		(Note: POSIX specifies that file descriptors can be 0 to minimum 19,
#		but most shells only support file descriptors between 0 and 9.)
#	--- comparison tests (2 arguments) ---
#	is newer, is older, is samefile:
#		Test if file 1 is newer than, older than, or (through hard
#		links or symlinks) the same file as file 2. (Note: the -nt,
#		-ot and -ef test/[ operators are technically non-standard, but
#		their support in shells that can run the rest of modernish is
#		universal.)

# If the <varname> argument is omitted, they copy standard input to standard output, converting case.
# NOTE: Some shells or external 'tr' commands cannot convert UTF-8 or other non-ASCII characters to upper
# or lower case. Modernish tries hard to make one or the other work, but sometimes neither the shell nor
# 'tr' can handle it. This is tested for as BUG_CNONASCII (see libexec/modernish/cap/BUG_CNONASCII.t). Be
# sure to check if 'thisshellhas BUG_CNONASCII' if you need to rely on converting non-ASCII characters.

# First, the default 'tr' commands.
# These may also be needed as a fallback for the 'typeset' method, so use a shell function to init them on demand.
# If we're in a UTF-8 locale, it's very hit-and-miss which command can convert case correctly; modernish will try
# 'tr', 'awk', GNU 'awk' and GNU 'sed' before giving up (and detecting BUG_CNONASCII).
# Basic form is:
